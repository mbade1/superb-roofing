Can we make the blue highlight on the page more bright cobalt blue like the logo? And also instead of white can we try a gray? Our colors are blue, black, and gray.
-For testimonials can we copy and paste what people have said on our other accounts like thumbtack pro and social media? And just put it in quotations with their name underneath and maybe a picture of before and after? I can try merging the pictures myself and send them that way.
-In the services section lets put pictures of the different types of roofs we have done, I'll send them with descriptions of each so you know what they are lol.
-And yes, I would like to add all the different platforms that we have, instagram, facebook, thumbtack pro, and the BBB.
-I would also like to put Josh's name stating he is the owner along with his number and maybe the address somewhere at the top, maybe across from the logo?
    DONE
-And pleeeeaaaasssseee for the love of me take the picture of me and faith off hahahahaha! I will send some updated family pics and all that!
    DONE
- For the tabs at the top of the mobile look, and even for the website, lets take out the about tab and just have 4 instead of 5. We will just have the about info at the top of the page.
    DONE
-And I would like the testimonial area to be more prominant, maybe moving it into its own section, whatever you think!
    DONE

    DONE










 And can we put Josh's picture maybe at the top with his info or at the bottom where you have the info again? And then have the picture of Faith and Abel at the about us? Idk. Do whatever you think is best lol. Look at it as someone looking for a roof and what you would look for on that roofers website? I looked at some yesterday and they are either over exagerative or just repetative. The before and after pics I sent though are the person that left the review so if you can, attach it to that. Maybe rewrite her review and have it over the pictures, but at the bottom. Play with it and let me know what you think! Again, thank you soooooooo much! You guys are truly the best! Love you! 

P.s. Super glad you only have 1 week left of your old job and praying for guidance with the new unknown! You guys are gonna do great no matter where God takes you! Much love ‚ù§
